# **What I learnt about Github**
## Git and GitHub
Git is a distributed **Version Control System** (VCS), which is a tool that tracks changes in code, whether working by yourself, or in a collaboration. By using Git, which is universally accepted as the best VCS, you can track your project with much more clarity, as you can easily collect a record of all versions you've worked on, and you can easily revert back to older versions of a project if needed. Git makes collaborating on projects a lot easier as well. Many people working on the same roject can merge their changes into one source/version.
